    A presentation on Oscar Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" and "The Critic as Artist" as seen in the Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism (Second Edition).
    This presentation will focus on the questions of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What are the arguments Wilde makes for the imagination, and for criticism as a form of art?
        \item How does the structure of the two pieces reflect Wilde's aesthetic philosophy?
    \end{enumerate}
